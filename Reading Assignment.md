  <h1> <center> Response to trend report </h1>
    <p> The trend that stuck out to me was that easy to use products are will become pervasive. The reason this stuck out to was because I 
    am a primary user of many of these apps, and I see myself as a contributor to this trend. For example, cash app had become an integral 
    part of personal and business philosophies. </p><br>
    <p> Personally, I use cash app as my primary source of cash transfers and often use it more than my actual Bank applications. Secondly,
    I subscribe to Apple Music. In its inception, Apple Music was a part of disruptive innovation. As we move toward a digital future, 
    apps like Apple Music and Spotify seem to be taking over. </p><br>
    <p> However, some of the terminology of the trend was interesting as well. The trend report said that these apps would be “pervasive.” 
    Oftentimes, new products are introduced, but they only reach select markets. However, referring to this new media as pervasive suggests 
    that it will reach a wider audience. The ease and accessibility of these apps likely contribute to the appeal because simplicity is 
    attractive.</p><br>
    <p> Still, it is highly unlikely that it will end here. The future is moving toward digitizing, increased accessibility, and ease of 
    access. Applications like Cash App and Apple Music are examples of this push. In the future, we will likely see more and more smart 
    products. On Monday, our group vaguely discussed things like “coffee radio” and “smart sidewalks” because it is likely that we will 
    see some revolutionary changes in the coming years. <p><br>
    <p>Already, we have seen the inception of smart cars, facial recognition software (with the iPhone X), and other technological advances we
    may not have been able to fathom 20 or even 10 years ago. It will be interesting to see how apps like Cash App and Apple Music will 
    contribute to this. <p> <br>
